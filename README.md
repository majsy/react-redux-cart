# Redux Shopping Cart

This is a copy of the [Redux Shopping Cart Example](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/shopping-cart).

To install dependencies, use the package manager [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/):

```
yarn

To start a development server:

```
yarn start
```

## Process

###### Responsive Layout

My approach for the layout was to add height/width to the container elements and give the child elements fluid sizes so I mainly had to update the container elements size depending on the breakpoint.
